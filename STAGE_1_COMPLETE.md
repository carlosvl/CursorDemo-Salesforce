# Annual Emission Inventory LWC - Stage 1 Complete! üéâ

## What We've Built

I've successfully created a Lightning Web Component (LWC) for Net Zero Cloud that will display Annual Emission Inventory records associated with an Account record. Here's what's included:

### üìÅ Files Created

#### LWC Component (`annualEmissionInventoryList`)
- **JavaScript Controller**: Handles data loading and processing
- **HTML Template**: Responsive data table with loading states
- **CSS Styles**: Professional styling with mobile responsiveness
- **Meta XML**: Configured for Account record pages

#### Apex Controller (`AnnualEmissionInventoryController`)
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches Annual Emission Inventory records
- **Security**: Includes CRUD permission checks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Wrapper Class**: Clean data structure for the LWC

#### Test Class (`AnnualEmissionInventoryControllerTest`)
- **Unit Tests**: Covers success and error scenarios
- **Placeholder Tests**: Ready for when Net Zero Cloud is installed

## üöÄ Next Steps - How to Test

### 1. Deploy to Your Org
```bash
# From your project root directory
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/lwc/annualEmissionInventoryList
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/classes/AnnualEmissionInventoryController.cls
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/classes/AnnualEmissionInventoryControllerTest.cls
```

### 2. Add Component to Account Record Page
1. Navigate to **Setup** ‚Üí **Lightning App Builder**
2. Edit an existing Account record page or create a new one
3. Drag the **Annual Emission Inventory List** component to your desired location
4. Save and activate the page

### 3. Test with Sample Data
Since Net Zero Cloud may not be installed yet, the component includes:
- **Loading state simulation**
- **Error handling**
- **Empty state display**
- **Responsive design**

## üîß Component Features

### ‚úÖ Current Features (Stage 1)
- **Responsive Data Table**: Shows Name, Reporting Year, Status, Owner, Last Modified
- **Loading States**: Professional spinner while data loads
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Empty State**: Clear messaging when no records exist
- **Status Color Coding**: Visual status indicators
- **Security**: CRUD permission validation
- **Mobile Friendly**: Stacked layout on small screens

### üé® Visual Design
- **Professional Card Layout**
- **SLDS (Salesforce Lightning Design System) compliant**
- **Status-based color coding** (Green for Finalized, Orange for In Progress, etc.)
- **Record count in header**
- **Sortable columns**

## üìã Ready for Stage 2!

The component is now ready for you to test. Once you confirm it works in your org, we can proceed to Stage 2, which could include:

1. **Enhanced Data Display**: Additional fields, filtering, sorting
2. **Interactive Features**: Click-to-navigate, inline editing
3. **Charts/Visualizations**: Emission trends, year-over-year comparisons
4. **Bulk Actions**: Export, mass updates
5. **Related Records**: Show related emission details

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

- **Object Name**: Uses `AnnualEmssnInventory` (based on Net Zero Cloud documentation)
- **Relationship Field**: Assumes `Account__c` lookup field
- **Cacheable**: Uses `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` for performance
- **Error Resilient**: Handles missing objects/fields gracefully

## üìû Test & Report Back

Please deploy this to your org and let me know:
1. Does the component appear in Lightning App Builder?
2. Can you add it to an Account record page?
3. What does it show (loading, error, or empty state)?
4. Any specific adjustments needed for your Net Zero Cloud setup?

Then we can move to Stage 2 with your feedback! üöÄ
